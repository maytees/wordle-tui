# Wordle TUI

Basic project I'm working on to get my hands messy with Rust after a year of not
touching this langauge.

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maytees/wordle-ui
```

then

```bash
cargo run
```

## How to play

Controls:

`<Ctrl-q> to exit`
`<Ctrl-v> to reveal word`
`<Ctrl-r> to refresh word` _not fully implemented_

Demo Video:
<video width="320" height="240" controls>

  <source src="video.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>
