# Wordle TUI

Basic project I'm working on to get my hands messy with Rust after a year of not
touching this langauge.

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maytees/wordle-ui
```

then

```bash
cargo run
```

## How to play

Controls:

`<Ctrl-q> to exit`

`<Ctrl-v> to reveal word`

`<Ctrl-r> to refresh word` _not fully implemented_
